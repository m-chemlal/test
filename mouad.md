**BIOS** stands for **Basic Input/Output System**. It is low-level firmware built into the motherboard of a computer and is responsible for initializing and testing hardware components when the system is powered on or restarted.

### Key Roles of BIOS:

1. **Hardware Initialization**:
    
    - BIOS runs the **Power-On Self-Test (POST)** to check if hardware components like the CPU, RAM, and storage drives are functioning properly.
2. **Boot Process**:
    
    - After hardware checks, the BIOS identifies the bootable device (hard drive, SSD, USB, etc.) and loads the bootloader (like GRUB) to start the operating system.
3. **Configuration Interface**:
    
    - The BIOS provides a configuration screen (accessed via a key like F2, F12, or DEL during startup) where users can:
        - Change boot device order.
        - Adjust hardware settings (e.g., enabling/disabling components, configuring clock speeds).
        - Set up security options like passwords.
4. **Communication Bridge**:
    
    - BIOS acts as a bridge between the operating system and the hardware, providing basic drivers to operate devices like the keyboard and display before the OS takes over.
